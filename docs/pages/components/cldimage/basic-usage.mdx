# Getting Started with CldImage

## Basic Usage

The basic required props include `width`, `height`, `src`, and `alt`:

```
<CldImage
  width="600"
  height="600"
  src="<Public ID>"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

<Callout emoji={false}>
  If using the Next.js 13 `app` directory, you must add the `use client;` directive at the top of your file.
</Callout>

The `src` property takes in a Cloudinary Public ID which includes the folder path along with the ID of the image itself.

<Callout emoji={false}>
  Tip: You can alternatively pass in a full Cloudinary URL as the `src`, however, it must include a version number (ex: `/v1234/`).
</Callout>

You can further take advantage of Cloudinary features like background removal and overlays by adding additional props:

```
<CldImage
  width="600"
  height="600"
  src="<Public ID>"
  crop="thumb"
  gravity="faces"
  removeBackground
  tint="100:blue:green:red"
  underlays={[{
    publicId: '<Public ID>',
    width: 600,
    height: 600,
    crop: 'fill'
  }]}
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

If using a full Cloudinary URL, you might already have transformations applied to your image.

To preserve those transformations, you can apply the `preserveTransformations` property:

```
<CldImage
  width="600"
  height="600"
  src="<Cloudinary URL>"
  preserveTransformations
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

As CldImage is a wrapper around the Next.js Image component, all built-in Image component features will work out-of-the-box.
