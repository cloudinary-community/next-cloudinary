### Callback Options

Most of the callbacks provide a set of options that give access to the widget instance and allow more interaction.

<Callout emoji={false}>
Future releases will work to create a more consistent interface between older methods and more recently added methods.
</Callout>

| Name               | Type               | Description                            |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| widget             | Widget             | The widget instance attached to the current component. |
| [Instance Methods] | function           | See below.                             |

## Composing Widget UI

CldUploadWidget uses Function as a Child component to pass options to the widget UI.

To make this work, use a function as the direct child of a CldWidget Instance:

```jsx copy
<CldUploadWidget>
  {({ cloudinary, widget, open }) => {
    // UI
  }}
</CldUploadWidget>
```

The first and only argument is an object that contains instances of cloudinary, the widget, various instance methods that can control the widget, and other data.

### Child Function Options

By passing in a function as the child of the Upload Widget, you're able to gain access to the widget, results, and instance methods to interface directly with the widget.

| Name               | Type               | Description                            |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| cloudinary         | Cloudinary         | The Cloudinary instance which creates and manages the Widget instance. |
| error              | string             | The error, if any, produced by an upload widget action. |
| isLoading          | boolean            | Designates whether the upload widget is loading and initializing. |
| results            | object             | The event that triggered the results and information related to that event, which can include upload results. |
| widget             | Widget             | The widget instance attached to the current component. |
| [Instance Methods] | function           | See below.                             |

## Instance Methods

| Name           | Type               | Description                            |

| hide           | Promise            | Closes the widget and completely removes it from the DOM. Returns a promise that resolves upon cleanup completion. |
| isDestroyed    | function           | Returns whether the destroy method was called on this instance. |
