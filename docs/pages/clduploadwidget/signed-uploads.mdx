# Signing CldUploadWidget Uploads

Signing requests is an easy way to provide enhanced security for your file uploads. This helps
deter people from making unauthenticated uploads to your cloud.

## Configuring Signed Uploads

Setting up CldUploadWidget to sign uploads is as simple as passing an API endpoint as a prop:

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { CldUploadWidget } from 'next-cloudinary';

  <CldUploadWidget signatureEndpoint="<API Endpoint (ex: /api/sign-cloudinary-params)>">
    {({ open }) => {
      return (
        <button onClick={() => open()}>
          Upload an Image
        </button>
      );
    }}
  </CldUploadWidget>
  ```
</CodeBlock>

However, that API endpoint needs to return a specific shape in order to properly communicate
with the CldUpload Widget.

## API Endpoint to Sign Requests

When working in Next.js, we gain access to a server environment through both somewhat traditional means
and serverless functions.

This means, we can use the [Cloudinary Node SDK](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration)
in order to easily sign our requests.

To start off, install the Cloudinary Node SDK with:

```shell
npm install cloudinary
```

In order to sign our requests, we'll need to use our Cloudinary API Key and Secret, so set additional
environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="<Your API Key>"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="<Your API Secret>"
``` 

Then, we want to create a new API endpoint, which differs based on whether or not you're using
the App Router or Pages router.

<Tabs items={['App Router', 'Pages Router']}>
  <Tab>
    **In the App Router**, create a new API route file such as `app/api/sign-cloudinary-params/route.ts`, where
    inside, add the folowing code.

    <CodeBlock>
      ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
      import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

      cloudinary.config({
        cloud_name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
        api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
        api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
      });

      export async function POST(request: Request) {
        const body = await request.json();
        const { paramsToSign } = body;

        const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(paramsToSign, process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET);
        
        return Response.json({ signature });
      }
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **In the Pages Router**, create a new API endpoint file such as `pages/api/sign-cloudinary-params.js`, where
    inside, add the folowing code:

    <Callout emoji={false} type="warning">
      If using Next Cloudinary v5 or lower, you need to use `JSON.parse(req.body)` to obtain the JSON payload
      of the Signature Request from the Upload Widget.
    </Callout>

    <CodeBlock>
      ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
      import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";

      cloudinary.config({
        cloud_name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
        api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
        api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
      });

      export default async function handler(req, res) {
        const { paramsToSign } = req.body;

        const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(paramsToSign, process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET);

        res.status(200).json({ signature });
      }
      ```
    </CodeBlock>
