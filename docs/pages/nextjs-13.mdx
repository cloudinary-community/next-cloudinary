# Next.js 13

Next.js 13 brings a new fundamental way of building Next.js apps with the App Router (`/app` directory). Part of that includes using React.js technology such as server components that have different requirements when bundling applications.

## Pages Router (/src)

By default, Next Cloudinary has full support when using the included components in the `src` directory with no further actions.

## App Router (/app)

### General

Using Next Cloudinary in the `app` directory currently requires marking the parent page or component as a Client Component.

At the top of the file, simply add:

```
"use client";
```

### Open Graph (OG) Images & Social Media Cards

The CldOgImage component utilizes the Next.js Head component to add metadata tags to the HTML document's `<head>`.

In the App Router, the Head component is no longer supported, instead opting for [configuration-based control of metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).

You can still easily generate OG images and social card URLs using [getCldOgImageUrl](/getcldogimageurl/basic-usage) in your metadata configuration.

```
import { getCldOgImageUrl } from 'next-cloudinary';

export const metadata = {
  openGraph: {
    ...
    images: getCldOgImageUrl({
      src: '<Public ID>'
    })
  },
};
```
