# Getting Started with CldImage

The CldImage component provides an easy way to deliver images from Cloudinary with the same experience you'd expect inside of a Next.js app.

With it comes access to more advanced features like dynamic cropping, background removal, overlays, and other Cloudinary transformations.

As CldImage is a wrapper around the Next.js Image component, you also gain access to all built-in Image component features will work out-of-the-box like [Responsive Sizing](/guides/responsive-images).

## Basic Usage

The basic required props include `width`, `height`, `src`, and `alt`:

```jsx
import { CldImage } from 'next-cloudinary';

<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src="<Public ID>"
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

The `sizes` prop is optional, but recommended for [Responsive Sizing](/guides/responsive-images).

</Callout>

<p className="nx-mt-6">
<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src={`${process.env.IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/turtle`}
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Turtle in the ocean"
/>
</p>

The `src` property takes in a Cloudinary Public ID which includes the folder path along with the ID of the image itself.

## Transformations

You can further take advantage of Cloudinary features like background removal and overlays by adding additional props:

```jsx
<CldImage
  width="1200"
  height="1200"
  src="<Public ID>"
  crop="thumb"
  removeBackground
  tint="70:blue:green:purple"
  underlay="<Public ID>"
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

<CldImage
  width="1200"
  height="1200"
  src={`${process.env.IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/turtle`}
  crop="thumb"
  removeBackground
  tint="70:blue:green:purple"
  underlay={`${process.env.IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/galaxy`}
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Turtle in the ocean"
/>

## Using Cloudinary URLs

If using a full Cloudinary URL, you might already have transformations applied to your image.

To preserve those transformations, you can apply the `preserveTransformations` property:

```jsx
<CldImage
  width="600"
  height="600"
  src="<Cloudinary URL>"
  preserveTransformations
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

*Note: Cloudinary URLs must include a version number (/v1234) in order to be correctly parsed.*
