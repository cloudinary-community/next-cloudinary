# Changelog

## v6.1.0

### Overview

Adds new top-level options to CldImage including Generative Enhance, Angle, and Loop.

Enhance is a Generative AI feature in Beta that will automatically improve the visual
appeal of an image.

Angle allows you to rotate an image by the given degrees or [custom mode](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#a_angle).

Loop allows you to apply a looping effect to an animated image, such as a gif, infinitely or by a specific number of times.

### Changes

**CldImage**
* Adds `enhance`
* Adds `angle` as a top-level effect, also available in the effects array
* Adds `loop` as a top-level effect
* Adds a test and console warning for `fillBackground` without a `width` and `height` or `aspectRatio`
* Fixes `zoompan` bug where passing custom options didn't include `:` required in transformation

## v6.0.0

### Overview

This is one of the more substantial updates since the launch of Next Cloudinary
which updates and fixes an underlaying mechanism in how the CldImage component works.

The CldImage component dynamically generates not only a single URL, but multiple
Cloudinary URLs through [responsive sizing](/guides/responsive-images) to provide as performant of an experience
as possible. To do this, we take advantage of Cloudinary's on-the-fly [cropping](/cldimage/configuration#crop)
and resizing.

While doing this, previous versions of the CldImage component used a 2-stage resize
process to provide an intuitive developer experience in how cropping was applied
to images, but this created a problem where resulting images would be limited to
the defined "rendered size" of an image, even if it was larger.

To resolve this, the 2-stage resizing is removed by default, but now available
to use as an opt-in mechanism behind the now advanced `crop` prop.

Learn more over on the RFC: https://github.com/cloudinary-community/next-cloudinary/discussions/432

Beyond that, there are a few type and prop deprecations with replacements
as necessary and bug fixes that required a slight breaking change.
