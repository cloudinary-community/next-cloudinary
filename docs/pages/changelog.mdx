# Changelog

## v6.0.0

### Overview

This is one of the more substantial updates since the launch of Next Cloudinary
which updates and fixes an underlaying mechanism in how the CldImage component works.

The CldImage component dynamically generates not only a single URL, but multiple
Cloudinary URLs through [responsive sizing](/guides/responsive-images) to provide as performant of an experience
as possible. To do this, we take advantage of Cloudinary's on-the-fly [cropping](/cldimage/configuration#crop)
and resizing.

While doing this, previous versions of the CldImage component used a 2-stage resize
process to provide an intuitive developer experience in how cropping was applied
to images, but this created a problem where resulting images would be limited to
the defined "rendered size" of an image, even if it was larger.

To resolve this, the 2-stage resizing is removed by default, but now available
to use as an opt-in mechanism behind the now advanced `crop` prop.

Learn more over on the RFC: https://github.com/cloudinary-community/next-cloudinary/discussions/432

Beyond that, there are a few type and prop deprecations with replacements
as necessary and bug fixes that required a slight breaking change.
