## Customization

### Logo

The `logo` prop gives the option to customize the player's logo.

`logo` defaults to `true`, showing the Cloudinary logo and linking to https://cloudinary.com when clicked.

When `logo` is set to `false`, no logo will be displayed.

To customize the logo, the following options are available in the form of an object:

| Prop Name          | Type          | Default        | Description                              |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| imageUrl           | string        | -              | Image URL for player logo.               |
| onClickUrl         | string        | -              | URL to browse to on logo click.          |

### Poster

The `poster` prop optionally takes a string or object to customize the generated poster.

When passing a string, you can either pass a Cloudinary Public ID or a remote URL to rendered the desired image.

When passing an object, use same configuration and API as [getCldImageUrl](/getcldimageurl/configuration) to customize the image.
You can either specify a `src` option with a custom public ID or omit the `src`, which will use the video's
ID to render an automatically generated preview image.

[View examples](/cldvideoplayer/examples#poster).
### Theme Colors

The `colors` prop takes an object that can control what colors are used in the player:

| Prop Name          | Type          | Default        | Description                              |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| accent             | string        | `"#FF620C"`    | Seek bar, volume control and for highlighting interactions. |
| base               | string        | `"#000000"`    | Player controls bar, information bar, central play button, and right-click context menu. |
| text               | string        | `"#FFFFFF"`    | All the text and icons that are present within the video player UI. |

Learn more about the color scheme options and how they're used [on the Cloudinary docs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_player_customization#color_scheme).

## Player APIs

### Event Handlers

The event props allow you to pass in a function that is called whenever the associated event occurs.

For instance, in order to trigger an event whenever a video is paused:

```jsx copy
<CldVideoPlayer onPause={({ player }) => {
  const duration = player.duration();
}} ... />
```

### Refs

The `playerRef` and `videoRef` props give you the ability to pass in your own ref to gain access to both the Player instance as well as the HTML video element on which the player is mounted.

To do this, create a new Ref instance and pass that in as the value of the prop:

```jsx copy
const myVideoRef = useRef();
...
<CldVideoPlayer videoRef={myVideoRef} ... />
```
