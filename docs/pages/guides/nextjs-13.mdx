# Next.js 13

Next.js 13 brings a new fundamental way of building Next.js apps with the `app` directory. Part of that includes using React.js technology such as server components that have different requirements when bundling applications.

## Pages Router (/src)

By default, Next Cloudinary has full support when using the included components in the `src` directory with no further actions.

## App Router (/app)

### General

Using Next Cloudinary in the `app` directory currently requires marking the parent page or component as a Client Component.

At the top of the file, add:

```
"use client"
```

### OG Images

The Head component is not supported in the Next.js App directory, meaning, the [CldOgImage](/components/cldogimage/basic-usage) component will not function.

Instead, you can easily generate OG image URLs using [getCldOgImageUrl](/helpers/getcldogimageurl/basic-usage) in your metadata configuration:


```
export const metadata = {
  openGraph: {
    ...
    images: getCldOgImageUrl({
      src: '<Public ID>'
    })
  },
};
```
