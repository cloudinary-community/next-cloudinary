# Next.js 13

Next.js 13 brings a new fundamental way of building Next.js apps with the `app` directory. Part of that includes using React.js technology such as server components that have different requirements when bundling applications.

# Src Directory

By default, Next Cloudinary has full support when using the included components in the `src` directory with no further actions.

# App Directory (Experimental)

Using Next Cloudinary in the `app` directory currently requires marking the parent page or component as a Client Component.

At the top of the file, add:

```
use client;
```
